During this workshop, I was able to get more comfortable with functions and how to apply the arguments called in my code. For loops were introduced, which can be useful for code that has to constantly have the same conditions met. In this lab, it was best to use the for loop for printing the lines as well as the calculations. For each of the lines, with their different characters and their respective lengths to be filled, they all could be run through the same loop. Storing their char and int values was done in the line condition, which prints their argument in the brackets into a line. The putchar function was also used which prints out the character held in the argument. For the calculation portion, it was mostly dependent on the user input of the number of items that were bought, which was also stored as the rowNumber integer. The for loop was needed because the program needed to be able to perform the same calculations, no matter the user input. This lab was a great way to learn more about how interconnected programming is.
