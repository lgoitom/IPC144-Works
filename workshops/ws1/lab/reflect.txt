When writing any program in C, there are standard functions that should always be included. <stdio.h> is a standard function that tells the computer to bring the input/output file which consists of a library of functions and their definitions. The main function is where the function begins. When the program is run, the code is being read and interpreted in the main function first and foremost. Inside it is where the code is placed or where other functions are being called from. Functions are called by a function prototype, which introduces a function and consists of its name, return type, and parameters. To call a function, it is done by functionName(functionArgument…). An argument consists of the declared values of a function when it is called which includes integers, floating points, etc. An integer in programming is a whole number with no decimal places following. A floating point in programming is a number with a decimal value and typically they are not precise. The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. The whole program should end with a return statement followed by a 0, which sends the program back to the operating system and therefore ending the program. Many of the issues I came across while completing the workshop involved formatting it precisely. Code has to be accurate in order for the whole program to run, otherwise it will not do so.
