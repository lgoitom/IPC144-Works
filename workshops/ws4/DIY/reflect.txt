During this workshop, I used a switch statement for the calculation portion of the program. I found it to be useful in running the program as it is effective in applying the appropriate operation system to what the user has input. With switch case statements, it matches each case with what the user input and runs the corresponding statements. If it matches neither of the cases, there is a default case which is there to execute for this kind of situation. Though it is possible to use if else statements, switch case statements look more organized and easier to read. Another concept that I was starting to get familiar with is scanning user input to see whether a certain character had been typed or not. A switch case could possibly be used in this case but I used an if else statement just because of familiarity. I also used a while loop inside the int calc function so that it can produce a true or false statement.
