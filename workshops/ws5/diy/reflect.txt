In this lab, we began to work with arrays, both int arrays and char arrays. The difference being that int arrays hold integers and char arrays can hold a string of characters. The identifiers are followed by a pair of square brackets that hold the amount of elements in the array. One of the requirements for this lab was to pass values from an array to another function. A specific example of this is the function that checks if user input is within the minimum and maximum. This was done by first writing the array name student number and square brackets around the row number element to refer to it. Then, it is initialized to the function, to check if user input is within the range, and typing each value in the order that matches each parameter requirement. This is a difficulty I faced while doing this lab. Another difficulty I faced was formatting the chart output with strings and qualifiers. It took a lot of trial and error to eventually format it perfectly.
